I wanted to port Processing 2.2.1 code described in [may_9_15_experiment](may_9_15_experiment) as a project to **test the current capabilities of agentic frameworks like Claude Code**.

I started to discuss this project with both ChatGPT (GPT-5.2 Extended Thinking with Web search explicitly on) and with Claude AI (Opus 4.5 with more thinking and search on via its default).

https://claude.ai/share/9376c131-2553-4fb6-9faf-51c23f10b05a

I was not quite sure what kind of system I wanted (potentially, I thought I might develop this further as a **VJing platform**, and I did not want to invest further efforts in a Processing codebase).

So the first question I asked the AI system reflected this uncertainty:

>Hi, I am thinking about porting an interactive animation from Processing programming language to a more conventional platform (perhaps, like Python or Julia or fast JS). If I choose Python or Julia, one question is whether to use their native animation facilities, or whether to use a JS front-end (presumably connecting via websockets). I am trying to ponder the trade-offs.
